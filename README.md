# Text-to-Listen-
The Text-to-Listen project is an engaging web application that transforms written text into natural-sounding speech using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This initiative aims to enhance accessibility for users who may have visual impairments, learning disabilities, or simply prefer auditory information.By harnessing the power of the Web Speech API, the project allows users to input text directly into a user-friendly interface, which then generates speech output in real time. The use of HTML provides a structured layout for the application, while CSS enhances the visual appeal, ensuring a pleasant user experience. JavaScript powers the functionality, enabling dynamic interaction and control over speech parameters, such as voice selection and speech rate. This project not only highlights the importance of accessible technology but also demonstrates how web development can be utilized to create practical solutions. Ultimately, the Text-to-Listen application aims to empower users by transforming text into speech, making information more accessible and engaging across various contexts.
